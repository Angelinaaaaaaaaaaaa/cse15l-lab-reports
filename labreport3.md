### The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)

![image](https://github.com/Angelinaaaaaaaaaaaa/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/115201846/929c3ca7-a50b-424d-ab1e-6f5a26c721d9)

### The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
Before:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```

After:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < (arr.length/2); i += 1) {
      int temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
  }
```
The original code attempted to reverse an array `arr` in place, but it had a critical flaw. It iterated through the entire array, and at each step, it replaced the current element with the element at the corresponding position counting from the end of the array. While this approach might seem logical, it led to an unintended behavior. After reversing the first half of the array, the code continued swapping elements, causing the second half of the array to overwrite the reversed elements, resulting in a symmetric but incorrect array.

To fix this issue, instead of attempting to reverse the entire array by iterating through it from start to end, I make the code only reverses the first half of the array, which is key to ensuring that we don't re-reverse the already reversed elements during the second half of the iteration. The revised code iterates through the array up to its midpoint (i.e., `arr.length/2`). During this iteration, it swaps the elements between the first half and the second half, effectively reversing the order. To achieve this, a temporary variable `temp` is used to store the value of the element at the current position before performing the swap. This ensures that the reversed elements are preserved, and the array is correctly reversed from start to finish.


## Part 2 - Researching Commands

I choose `grep` command, and  I used online search on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/ and combined the command on the files we used in lab.

### Option 1: -i (Ignore case)
The -i option is used to perform a case-insensitive search. It allows grep to match patterns regardless of the letter casing, making it useful when you want to find matches regardless of whether they are in uppercase or lowercase.

For instance, as I search for 'LEGAL' in Media folder and 911report folder, all txt files with the word legal in them are found.

### Option 2: Recursive Search (-r)
The -r (or --recursive) option is used for recursive searching. When this option is specified, grep searches not only in the specified directory but also in all subdirectories. It's handy for searching for patterns across an entire directory tree.

```
Angelina Zhang@AngelinaZ MINGW64 ~/Desktop/cse15l/docsearch (main)
$ grep -r "unsupported" technical/
technical/biomed/1471-2148-2-17.txt:          probability as estimated by MrBayes and unsupported as

```
Angelina Zhang@AngelinaZ MINGW64 ~/Desktop/cse15l/docsearch (main)
$ grep -r "unsupported" technical/biomed/

technical/biomed/1471-2148-2-17.txt:          unsupported within a
technical/biomed/1471-2148-2-17.txt:          for this subclade is unsupported by the ITS data.
```
For instance, I searched for the word unsupported in two folders, and the `-r` let it recursively search for this word in all files in the directory and subdirectories.

### Option 3: -w (word-regexp)

This option tells grep to match whole words only, ensuring that the pattern is surrounded by non-word characters (such as spaces, punctuation, etc.) and it's used when you want to search for a pattern as a complete word and not as a substring within other words.

```
Angelina Zhang@AngelinaZ MINGW64 ~/Desktop/cse15l/docsearch (main)
$ grep -w "LEGAL" technical/911report/*.txt

For instance, when I searched for LEGAL in every txt files under the folder 911report, there is no results. However, if I search for the lower case legal, there are multiple results, which validate the case we tried for -i.

### Option 4: -L (files-without-match)

This option instructs grep to list the names of files and suppresses normal output, which helps to quickly identify files contain words.

```
Angelina Zhang@AngelinaZ MINGW64 ~/Desktop/cse15l/docsearch (main)
$ grep -l "legal" technical/911report/*.txt
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
technical/911report/chapter-10.txt
technical/911report/chapter-11.txt
technical/911report/chapter-12.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.1.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.3.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.4.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.5.txt
technical/911report/chapter-3.txt
technical/911report/chapter-6.txt
technical/911report/chapter-7.txt
technical/911report/chapter-8.txt
```

```
Angelina Zhang@AngelinaZ MINGW64 ~/Desktop/cse15l/docsearch (main)
$ grep -l "LEGAL" technical/911report/*.txt
```

```
Angelina Zhang@AngelinaZ MINGW64 ~/Desktop/cse15l/docsearch (main)
$ grep -l "unsupported" technical/biomed/*.txt
technical/biomed/1471-2148-2-17.txt
```

For instance, when I searched again for the lower case legal, there are multiple results and each file only appears once without showing every lines with the word in it. Also, the unsupported word only appears in one txt file, which is the same as past example suggests.
